    "An API or _Application Programming Interface_ is a tool for applications to talk to talk to each other. It's a commonly used term and has multiple meanings.

You may not know if it does until you encounter a \"status code\" of 407 (more on status codes below).

The response comes with a bunch of data in what is called _header_ but, for our purposes, we're only worried about the **status code** of the reponse because that can tell us if we're having issues connecting or requesting data. Most people have encountered the _404 Not Found_ code while browsing the web at some point, but there are mahy codes that we can encounter. Here are a few basic ones you should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `200 OK` - Standard response for successful HTTP requests.\n",
    "- `400 Bad Request` - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error.\n",
    "- `403 Forbidden` - The request was valid, but the server is refusing action.\n",
    "- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.\n",
    "- `407 Proxy Authentication Required` - The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.\n",

    "### Parsing Response Data (JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "Web-APIs can respond in many different data formats but the most commonly used one is **JSON** which stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_. JSON is a convenient data format because it is _human-readable_ and easy for machines to _parse_ and create as well. It relies on name/value pairs which is conveniently similar to the Python _dictionary_ datatype. You can read more about it on the [JSON.org](www.json.org/) website.\n",
